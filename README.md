# Beeline iOS technical challenge

## Install
1. Git clone this repo
2. Open Beeline.xcworkspace

## Note:
I roughly wrote a navigation map app with RxSwift.

Scroll map to select the destination.

It can calculate expectedTravelTime and total distances from current location to destination.

I change transportType to walking to fit bicycle riding.

The app icon was drawn by myself. Hope you like the color.



I was inspired from some YouTube videos.
